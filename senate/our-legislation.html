That can't happen anymore: our administration needs to be responsive to the concerns of the student body. Under my plan, the Senate will be able to hold special sessions where students can question both UNT and student government executives.</p>

However, UNT didn't make an effort to inform us about further options even as many of us struggled with the new environment.

It doesn't make sense that we're only given one seat to represent our concerns while other schools and colleges willingly leave theirs unfilled. Under my plan, TAMS students will be able to temporarily fill other colleges' unused Senate seats.</p>

Yet in most cases, it's what our student government uses to conduct its elections, meaning that someone can win their election without winning an outright majority. Under our plan, we will advise the student government Election Board to formally adopt instant-runoff voting.</p>
